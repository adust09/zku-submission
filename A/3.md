When paper is shredded, it becomes shredded and it takes a lot of effort to put it back together.
Similarly, information in computers can be restored using hash functions, which require a great deal of effort from the person who is using it.
This section describes cryptographic hash functions.

### 1.Collision Resistance

Difficult to find two different inputs that would output the same hash when only the cryptographic hash function is known

### 2.Original Image Computational Difficulty

Difficult to find the original image of a hash when only the hash function and hash are known

### 3.Second difficulty in computing the original image

When a hash function and a source image are known, it is difficult to find another source image that outputs the same hash

Consider an attack that identifies a message by its hash value.

Assuming that a typical desktop computer is capable of 60 million hash calculations per second, the number of attempts required to find a solution by a brute force attack is $ 2^{255} $, so the time required to find a solution is

$2^{255}÷(60×10^6)≈3×10^{61}$ years

Even if 1 trillion computers were running in parallel, it would take $3×10^{49}$ years.

This computational security is the basis for the security of hash functions and digital signatures.

Such hash functions are called one-way hash functions, but in fact, no hash function with perfect one-way security has been found, and since it is "probably safe," researchers are working hard to develop attack methods and select secure functions.

Among them, the series called SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm) selected by NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) is the de facto standard, and SHA1, SHA2, and SHA3 have been selected so far (strictly speaking, SHA0 also exists). is)
SHA1 has been found to cause hash value collisions and is rarely used today.
Bitcoin Core uses SHA2 (SHA256) and Ethereum uses SHA3.
