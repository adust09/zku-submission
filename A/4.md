# 1.Ask more than one person - statistical proof

The prover tells the verifier that object $A$ is red and object $B$ is blue.

Upon receiving this message, the verifier asks a passerby the colors of the two objects.

Most people will be able to answer this question correctly, although there will be a few people who will tell a lie in order to tease the verifier.

I think we can optimistically estimate that we can statistically verify the proof from a large number of sampling results.

However, this method does not have the beauty of the $Σ$ protocol because the sampling is outsourced to numerous third parties.

# 2.Ask another organ/function - proposition substitution

I figured that if I am colorblind, I can replace it with another organ.
That is the function of the eyes to capture images and the ears to hear sounds.

A long time ago, video game consoles used cables like this.
The yellow cable is for video and the other two cables are for audio.

(Here, to simplify matters, we exclude the existence of black cables and assume that only red and yellow cables exist.)

In this case, cable terminal = input, TV and game console = verification device, and the verifier (colorblind) determine if the correct input combination (true/false) is being used.
The audio and video output from the device for verification is confirmed by the simultaneous output of audio and video from the device for verification.

Here, we have replaced "different color " with " different function" and we believe that verification is complete when we can confirm that the two cables are in fact different functions.

This is easy; just plug in each cable one at a time and check the audio or video.

The colorblind person will not know what color those cables are, but each one has a different function, which you alone can verify.
And no matter how many times you repeat this trial, the result will be the same.

If the game company gave you cables of the same color, you will not be able to tell and you can enjoy either video-only or audio-only games :(

This method flow can also be said to allow colorblind users to verify the game company's explanation that different colored cables function differently!

This is not a general-purpose proof method and has some drawbacks, but it is $non-intaractive$ while satisfying $"completeness," "soundness,”$ and $"zero-knowledge"$ right?
