# Concept

Smart contracts can be compared to vending machines.

(1) Insert money
(2)Push the button
(3)The drink comes out.

What if this sequence of events could be done online?
Smart contracts are one way to make this possible, and are used in many blockchain protocols, including Ethereum. What makes it different from regular online shopping is that anyone can deploy on the protocol, giving it the flexibility and scalability to combine multiple contracts.
It is also fairer than other forms of online shopping because, due to the nature of the blockchain, no one can alter the contents of the contract or the transaction after the fact (although some protocols allow it).

# How is it deployed?

Smart contracts are programmed in the programming languages solidity and Rust, allowing developers to freely deploy remittance transactions such as deposit and staking on the blockchain network.
(In other words, everyone in the world will be happy to run your program and exchange or increase their assets!)

The created contract is compiled (converted into a language understood by machines) and converted into byte code (machine language) called ABI.
This bytecode is then passed to the VM for further processing.
Specifically, an opcode is prepared in the same way as Bitcoin, and a script is executed based on the bytecode.
